## Hello, I'm Lynnette! 👋

### 📱 I enjoy developing mobile apps!
- 👩‍💻 I'm a 3rd year NUS Computer Science student specialising in **Software Engineering** and **Database Systems**
- 🔥 Some of my skills include TypeScript/JavaScript (React Native), PHP (Laravel API), Java, Python, PostgreSQL (& PL/pgSQL)
- 🖤 I enjoy crafting intuitive frontends and architecting robust backends that drive seamless user experiences!

### 🔨 Some projects I've worked on this year:

<details>
<summary><strong>⭐TodoApp</strong></summary>
  
Link to repo: https://github.com/lynnetteeee/TodoApp

A simple TodoApp written in TypeScript with React Native. App allows addition, deletion, mark/unmark-as-done, and allows keeping track of multiple lists. 

The TodoApp repository saw various improvements and refinements such as updating Id generation, integrating frontend with server, and implementing global state management for tasks. Tasks updating was refactored to avoid prop-drilling and high coupling with prop types. NativeEventEmitter was attempted but unsuccessful. Other updates include enhancing delete list feature, fixing navigation functionalities and visual enhancements like button styling and shadow effects.

An automated GitHub profile generator made with a group of friends that creates a **personalised** README for your recent contributions, and is scheduled to update every month! It also automatically generates a wordcloud that you can include! 

In fact, the README you're seeing now is built on top of the monthly update! Installation instructions are in the main repo linked below :)
