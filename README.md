This repository contains a comprehensive guide to setting up and using a popular software tool. It includes installation instructions, usage guidelines, and troubleshooting tips for seamless implementation.

The TodoApp repository saw various improvements and refinements such as updating Id generation, integrating frontend with server, and implementing global state management for tasks. Tasks updating was refactored to avoid prop-drilling and high coupling with prop types. NativeEventEmitter was attempted but unsuccessful. Other updates include enhancing delete list feature, improving method comments, and fixing navigation functionalities for TodoScreen. New features like task addition, list creation, and navigation were also added, along with visual enhancements like button styling and shadow effects.
